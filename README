Bear Transit, otherwise known as the UC Berkeley campus shuttle, is 
a convenient transit system that takes you around campus and it's 
nearby vicinities.  Berkeley Campus Shuttle is an Android app that
will allow your Android based phone to use the bus schedules' to 
estimate the arrival of the next bus.  

Other transit agencies like AC Transit and BART has nextbus.com,
which actually uses GPS to estimate the next bus/train.  However,
Bear Transit only has a web page that lists the time arrivals 
for each route.  This app takes that data and puts it in a 
simple and friendly format for you while on-the-go.  

Features:
   * Select by which route (i.e. Perimeter, Reverse) and stop
     (i.e. Cory Hall: Hearst Ave and LeRoy Ave) to predict. 
   * Select which stop you want to predict.  It will return 
     predictions for all routes that serve that stop.
   * Save favorite routes and favorite stops so you can quickly
     jump to their predictions without navigating through everything.
     
Features to possibly come:
   * Use GPS to find closest stop and return predictions.  
   * Create a widget that counts down on the time remaining at a 
     given stop.
